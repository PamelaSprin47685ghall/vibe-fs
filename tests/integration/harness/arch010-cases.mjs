/**
 * gate-arch010-cases.mjs — N4. ARCH-010's document rules, enforced over real payloads.
 *
 * The clause's gate section names what must be checked. `synthetic-toml.test.mjs` already proves the
 * WRITER behaves; this proves the CLAUSE holds over what production actually renders, which is a
 * different claim. A producer that hand-assembles a document, or calls the writer and then appends to
 * the result, passes every writer test and violates ARCH-010.
 *
 * Two halves, and both are necessary:
 *
 *   positive   every real rendering from every migrated producer conforms. Uses production's own
 *              renderers, so a producer that changes shape fails here rather than in a canary
 *   negative   each rule refuses a fixture built to break exactly it. 「门禁必须红过一次才算存在」
 *
 * The negative half is why this file is long. A rule never seen refusing anything is indistinguishable
 * from a rule that cannot refuse — the four pseudo-gates this migration measured (`epochCold`,
 * `faultFor`, `boundaryFor`, the empty `resetHeartbeat`) were all green against the only tree anyone
 * ran them on.
 *
 * ── the containment case is the one that would silently invert ──────────────
 *
 * A payload value may legitimately contain `#`, `[[table]]` and `key = value`: that is the whole point
 * of ARCH-010's data containment. So a checker that scanned lines without tracking literal blocks
 * would report violations for payloads that are CORRECT, and the natural "fix" would be to weaken the
 * rules until those payloads passed — leaving a gate that accepts real violations too. Hence
 * `a_value_that_looks_like_syntax_is_not_a_violation`, asserted with the nastiest body available.
 *
 * Production is reached through `tests/e2e/production.js` rather than by importing the emitted
 * modules here. Two reasons, both measured while writing this file: `ForkChildPayload.render` reads a
 * plain JS array as an EMPTY F# list without throwing, and the fable-library directory carries its
 * version — this file's first draft hardcoded `fable-library-js.4.30.0` against a tree at `5.13.0`,
 * which would have thrown at import. The facade resolves both.
