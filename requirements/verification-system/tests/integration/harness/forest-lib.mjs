/**
 * gate-forest-lib.mjs — the shared device K10 (forest-wide determinism) and K11
 * (mutation self-checks) both drive. One harness, deliberately, because two would drift
 * and the drift would be invisible: each file would still be green about its own copy.
 *
 * `design-script-forest.md:581` states the property K10 has to prove — 「森林自检：同请求
 * 序列 → 同内容序列」 — and it is the only one of K10's four items that is FOREST-wide
 * rather than per-fixture. The other three (no dead edges, no index conflict, bounded
 * faults) are already enforced at load time by `scenario-schema.js`. So what this file
 * has to make possible is: compile all fifteen real scenarios, derive a request sequence
 * for one, drive it, and serialise the run to text two runs can be compared on.
 *
 * ── the derived sequence, and why it is derived rather than written ──────────
 *
 * A hand-written per-scenario request fixture would encode fifteen copies of the thing
 * the property is supposed to check: if the fixture and the scenario disagree the
 * fixture wins, and the run stays green while proving nothing about the file a human
 * edited. So the sequence comes from the compiled scenario alone, by four rules:
 *
 *   session   ONE synthetic session per declared TURN
 *   turn text `turnFragments(turn).join(FRAGMENT_GAP)`
 *   step      one synthetic assistant message appended per step
 *   attempts  a step governed by a fault is delivered `max(attempts) + 1` times
 *
 * The session rule is the one that needed measurement. `lanesOf` treats a binding as
 * alias → SET of sessions, so binding several sessions to one alias is legitimate rather
 * than a workaround (`orchestrator-publish` really does fork two Reviewers). Three
 * measured reasons to use one session per turn instead of one per lane:
 *
 *   a turn declares `tools`, and tools are part of the wire identity, so two turns of one
 *   lane with different tool sets cannot share a seal chain — `fast-manager`'s
 *   `manager-guard` (fork/join/list) and `blogger` (no tools) would break ARCH-004 on the
 *   second request and the sequence would be testing the seal instead of the lookup
 *
 *   an `internal` turn declares no lane at all, and `resolveEntry` admits
 *   `entry.lane === undefined` at ANY session, so its session can simply stay unbound —
 *   no alias has to be invented for it, which would be the harness making up a fact
 *
 *   production forks a fresh session per child anyway, so one-per-turn is closer to the
 *   wire than one-per-lane would be
 *
 * Ordering is the compiled entry order, which is TOML declaration order. Nothing here
 * iterates a Map or a Set to decide sequence.
 *
 * ── what the derived sequence is NOT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Named here so K10 can scope its case honestly instead of appearing to cover more than
 * it does. All fifteen scenarios ARE derivable (measured), with three limits:
 *
 *   the request carries the DECLARED PREFIX, not production's full utterance. For an
 *   `internal` turn the declaration is only the head of a prompt production composes, so
 *   determinism is proven over the forest's own declarations — not over the bytes the
 *   Host will actually send. That is why this cannot replace a canary.
 *
 *   the ORDER is a canonical enumeration, not production's causal order: no fork/join
 *   wiring, no restart, no title-after-first-turn timing. Those depend on the Host, and
 *   a sequence that guessed at them would be a fixture again.
 *
 *   a `tool-call` response is followed by a plain synthetic assistant message rather than
 *   an assistant call plus its tool result. `step` counts assistant messages, so the
 *   count is faithful; the transcript is not.
 *
 * ── serialisation: what IS compared ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Excluding everything that could vary would make byte-equality vacuous, so the line
 * format is stated positively. Per request, four fields:
 *
 *   resolved entry id   which content edge answered — the old `pathCursor` bug moved this
 *   selection kind      deliver / fault / unmatched / ambiguous / seal-broken
 *   attempt             the physical delivery counter, so a fault plan is visible
 *   response digest     sha256 of the canonical response body actually chosen
 *
 * Nothing is excluded as run-varying, because by construction nothing here varies:
 * session ids are derived from turn ids, and the response bodies come from the TOML. The
 * property therefore still has teeth — it fails if selection ever depends on arrival
 * order, on Map/Set iteration order, or on anything a fresh runtime does not carry.
 *
 * A header line naming the scenario and the request count is prepended so that two runs
 * that produced NO requests cannot compare equal by both being empty.
 *
 * ── patching: measured, and direct module patching is impossible ────────────
 *
 * `withPatched` refuses an ES module namespace rather than pretending. Measured on this
 * platform (node, .mjs, strict mode):
 *
 *   Object.prototype.toString.call(ns)              '[object Module]'
 *   Object.isFrozen(ns)                             false
 *   getOwnPropertyDescriptor(ns, 'sealDecision')    { writable: true, configurable: false }
 *   ns.sealDecision = fn                            TypeError: Cannot assign to property
 *                                                   'sealDecision' of [object Module]
 *   Object.defineProperty(ns, 'sealDecision', …)     TypeError: Cannot redefine property
 *
 * The descriptor is the trap: it reports `writable: true` while the module namespace
 * exotic object's [[Set]] always fails. A patcher that trusted the descriptor would
 * conclude it had patched. Under CommonJS (`node -e`, sloppy mode) the assignment does
 * not even throw — it silently no-ops — which is exactly the vacuously-green K11 the
 * brief warns about.
 *
 * `configurable: false` is what separates a module namespace from a patchable carrier, so
 * that is the property this checks, and the patch is then verified by reading the value
 * back. Two carriers do work and were measured: a class prototype
 * (`ScenarioRuntime.prototype.select` — writable, configurable, patch took effect and
 * restored) and any ordinary object.
 *
 * The consequence for K11 is a better shape than module patching would have been: three
 * of its four classes are naturally expressed as a mutated INPUT — a wrong scenario
 * source, or a request an incorrect implementation would have admitted — driven through
 * the UNMODIFIED forest, with `rejectsSelect` asserting the refusal. A mutated input
 * cannot fail to apply, and it proves the shipped code rejects the mutation rather than
 * proving a stand-in does.
